            This project is dedicated to all those students who have had trouble figuring out the
                                                    graph of an expression. With the attractive look and feel of the graphs, users can not only 
                                                    display one, but upto 3 expressions. This could prove helpful in understanding where the lines 
                                                    intersect, how they exponentially grow, etc. This is an open source project (or will be, soon).

            Graph-Ex allows users to not only plot equations using text fields, but also upload a picture of
                        the expression. For now, due to shortage of time, this project is limited to three equations in text fields.
                        And only one in the picture form. In Sha Allah, with the passage of time, we will not only increase the number
                        of equations that can be plotted, but also introduce features like scientific calculations, trigonometric fucntions.
                        Please take a look and the instructions of usage at the bottom of the page.

        <p>Using Graph-Ex to plot is really simple. Type in the expressions in the text fields or
            you can take a snap and upload the image. When uploading or typing the expression, there are a 
            few things that you need to consider.
            <ul>
                <li>Please use caret <code>^</code> symbol when you need to use exponents.</li>
                <li>Only variable <code>x</code> is allowed as the graph being plotted is a 2D.</li>
                <li>For now, the only operations you can perform are simple arithmetic <code>(+, -, /, *)</code>.</li>
                <li>Make sure the image you are uploading has expression written horizontally on it.</li>
                <li>Leave enough gap between the numbers that it is easily recognizable.</li>
                <li>Enjoy plotting :)</li>
